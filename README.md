# Django-HangmanGame
Hangman Game Project
- Developed a Hangman game using the Django framework, incorporating JavaScript functions and utilizing the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture. Created Http request/response in Django views and Django models to work with different themes of the game.
- Frontend Development: Created multiple HTML templates to represent different game screens and implemented JavaScript functions to handle game logic and user interactions. Used window.addEventListener to listen for events and update the game state accordingly. Captured key presses for letter guesses and updated the game state dynamically by displaying sounds and images of hangman.
- Styling and Design: Utilized CSS stylesheets to enhance the visual appearance of the game, including customizing the game interface, displaying screenshots for different game stages, and implementing responsive design principles.
- Data Management: Implemented Python coding in Django views to read CSV files containing word lists for different Hangman game categories. Utilized Django models to transform the CSV data into tables using the SQLite database.
- Database Integration: Integrated the SQLite database with Django models to store and retrieve game data, game progress, and word lists for different categories.- Developed a Hangman game using the Django framework, incorporating JavaScript functions and utilizing the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture.
